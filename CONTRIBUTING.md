# Contributing to the React Admin project
Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing! Before making pull requests, please read this contributing guide so that your contribution doesn't go unnoticed!

## Open Issues
Every contribution / pull request needs to be associated to one or more [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/ordercloud-javascript-sdk/issues). New issues are added to the [project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Sitecore/projects/3) for review before they are considered "ready" to be worked on.

Before logging a new issue, please check to see if your concern / idea has already been logged.

Once an issue is moved (by a project maintainer) to the "Todo" column in the project backlog it is considered ready to be worked on. Please assign yourself and mark the issue as "In Progress" once development has started in order to avoid duplicate work.

## Development
1. Fork and clone the template repository locally, be sure to check "Include all branches" to get the development branch
2. Follow the working locally guide outlined in the main README.md
3. After you have completed development, run `npm test` and `npm build` locally to ensure everything still works.
4. Feel free to push changes to your forked development branch or create a new feature branch if it's a larger change.
5. Open a pull request to the main repository `development` branch. Ensure that the pull request is linked to the issues you are addressing in the pull request and include a verbose description of the changes / fix / feature.
6. A maintainer will review your pull request. They will either approve and merge or request further changes.
7. Once your PR is merged, it will be slotted for the next release (merge into `main` branch).

> **Important Note** - Ensure that you have recently pulled the latest from the main repository `development` branch before you begin new development.

## Repository Structure
