OrderCloud's extended properties feature allows you to extend the data model of any entity object in OrderCloud. This folder will extend the base OrderCloud models and enrich them with any custom xp properties required for this project. In order to avoid collision with the base models we will be prepending the model name with the letter I. For example the model Order will be IOrder. Check out one of the files in this folder for examples on how to do that
